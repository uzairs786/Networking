# 🌍 DNS – Domain Name System

DNS is the **phonebook of the internet** 📖.  
It allows us to access websites using easy-to-remember names (like `google.com`) instead of typing long IP addresses (like `142.250.190.78`).

## 🔑 Key Points
- 🖥️ **What it does** → Translates **domain names** into **IP addresses**.  
- 🌍 **Why it matters** → Humans remember names, machines use numbers.  
- 🚀 **Benefit** → Simplifies navigation across the internet.  

---

## 📡 Example
1. You type `www.google.com` into your browser.  
2. DNS finds the corresponding IP address (e.g., `142.250.190.78`).  
3. Your browser connects to that IP, and the website loads.  

```

User enters "google.com" 🌍

## 📝 Summary
- DNS = Internet’s phonebook 📖.  
- Converts **human-friendly names** → **machine-friendly IPs**.  
- Without DNS, we’d have to remember every site’s IP address.
