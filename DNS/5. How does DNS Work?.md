# 🌍 How DNS Works – Resolution, Hierarchy & Process

DNS = the process of turning **domain names → IP addresses** so browsers can find websites.

## 🏗️ DNS Hierarchy
Think of DNS like an **organization chart**:

```

ROOT (The Boss 👑)
│
├── TLD Servers (Department Heads 🏢)
│       ├── .com
│       ├── .org
│       └── .net
│
└── Authoritative Servers (Managers 👨‍💼)
├── google.com → has DNS zone file
└── qq.com → has DNS zone file

```

- **Root Servers** 👑 → Know where to find TLDs (but not domains directly).  
- **TLD Servers** 🏢 → Store info for extensions like `.com`, `.org`.  
- **Authoritative Servers** 👨‍💼 → Store actual DNS records (A, MX, CNAME, etc.).  
- **Zone File** 📂 → Lives inside authoritative servers and contains the records.

## 🔎 Step-by-Step: DNS Resolution
When you type `google.com` into your browser:

```

1️⃣ Browser checks local cache + /etc/hosts 🖥️
│
└─> If found → returns IP ✅ Done.
│
▼
2️⃣ If not found → ask DNS Resolver (ISP or public like 8.8.8.8) 🔎
│
└─> Resolver checks its cache.
│
▼
3️⃣ If not cached → Resolver queries ROOT 👑
│
└─> Root replies: "Ask the .com TLD server."
│
▼
4️⃣ Resolver queries .com TLD 🏢
│
└─> TLD replies: "Ask google.com’s authoritative server."
│
▼
5️⃣ Resolver queries Authoritative Server 👨‍💼
│
└─> Authoritative server replies with final IP (e.g., 142.250.180.14).
│
▼
6️⃣ Resolver caches the answer for next time 🗂️
│
▼
7️⃣ Resolver returns IP to your browser 🌍
│
▼
8️⃣ Browser connects to the website server 🖥️

```

## 🏢 Registrar vs DNS Hosting
- **Registrar** → Where you buy/register a domain (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.).  
- **DNS Hosting Provider** → Where DNS records are managed (Cloudflare, AWS Route 53, etc.).  
- Sometimes they are the same company, sometimes different.  

---

## ✅ Quick Summary
- DNS is **hierarchical**: Root 👑 → TLD 🏢 → Authoritative 👨‍💼.  
- **Resolvers** do the work of walking the DNS tree.  
- Steps: Local Cache → Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative → IP → Browser.  
- Registrars sell domains, DNS hosts manage the records.
