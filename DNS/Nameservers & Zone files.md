# 🌍 DNS Components – Nameservers & Zone Files (Simplified)

---

## 🖥️ Nameservers = DNS Helpers
Nameservers are special computers that help answer:  
👉 “What is the IP address of this website?”

### 🔑 Types
- ✅ **Authoritative Nameservers** → Have the **real records** (final answer).  
- 🔄 **Recursive Nameservers** → Do the **searching** for you (ask other servers, cache results).  

📌 Example:  
```bash
dig +short NS google.com
````

Might return:

```
ns1.google.com.
ns2.google.com.
ns3.google.com.
ns4.google.com.
```

## 📂 Zone Files = DNS Instruction Sheets

* A **zone file** is a **text file** stored on authoritative nameservers.
* It contains the **rules for a domain**.

### Common Records:

* 🌍 **A Record** → Maps a domain → IP address
* 📧 **MX Record** → Tells where email should go
* 🖥️ **NS Record** → Lists which nameservers are in charge

📌 Example snippet:

```
google.com.   IN  A   142.250.190.78
google.com.   IN  MX  10 smtp.google.com.
google.com.   IN  NS  ns1.google.com.
```
