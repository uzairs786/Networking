# 🔎 How DNS Records Work in Action

When you type a domain into your browser, DNS looks up the right **record type** depending on what you’re trying to do.  

---

## 🌍 Example 1 – Visiting a Website
```

User enters "google.com" 🌍
│
▼
DNS checks Zone File 📂
│
▼
Finds A record → 216.58.204.79 🔢
│
▼
Browser connects → Website loads 🖥️

```

---

## 📧 Example 2 – Sending an Email
```

User sends email to [user@google.com](mailto:user@google.com) 📧
│
▼
DNS checks Zone File 📂
│
▼
Finds MX record → mail.google.com ✉️
│
▼
Mail server receives the email 📬

```

---

## 🔗 Example 3 – Alias with CNAME
```

User enters "[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)" 🔗
│
▼
DNS finds CNAME → google.com 🌍
│
▼
google.com has A record → 216.58.204.79 🔢
│
▼
Browser connects → Website loads 🖥️

```

---

## 📝 Example 4 – Domain Verification
```

Service wants to check domain ownership 🛡️
│
▼
DNS finds TXT record → "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
│
▼
Verification complete ✅

```

## ✅ Takeaway
- 🌍 **A / AAAA** → Map domains to IP addresses.  
- 📧 **MX** → Directs email to the right mail server.  
- 🔗 **CNAME** → Aliases one domain to another.  
- 📝 **TXT** → Used for verification & email security.
