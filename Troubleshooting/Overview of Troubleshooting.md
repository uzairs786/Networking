# 🛠️ Network Troubleshooting Essentials

---

## 🚦 Why Troubleshooting Matters
- ✅ Keeps network running smoothly (like regular car maintenance 🚗).  
- 🕵️ Helps **identify & fix issues** quickly.  
- ⏱️ Minimizes **downtime** → saves productivity & business impact.

## ⚡ Common Network Issues
1. **Connectivity Loss**  
   - Sudden internet drop (like a phone call cutting out 📞).  
   - Causes: hardware failure, cable damage, misconfigured router, ISP issues.  

2. **Slow Network Performance**  
   - Webpages load slowly, file downloads crawl 🐢.  
   - Causes: congestion, misconfigurations, faulty hardware.  

3. **IP Address Conflicts**  
   - Two devices share the same IP (like two houses with the same street address 🏠🏠).  
   - Results in devices dropping off the network.  

4. **DNS Failures**  
   - Domain names don’t resolve (browser can’t find google.com 🌐).  
   - Often caused by DNS misconfig, cache issues, or unreachable servers.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Workflow

### 1️⃣ Observe the Problem
- Is the network down or just slow?  
- A specific device or the whole network?  
- Any visible issues? (loose/damaged cables).  

### 2️⃣ Verify Configurations
- Check router/firewall settings.  
- Confirm devices have correct **IP addresses, subnet masks, DNS configs**.  
- Look for duplicates (IP conflicts).  

### 3️⃣ Test Connectivity
- Use **`ping`**:  
  ```bash
  ping google.com
````

* Success = device can reach network/Internet.
* Failure = problem with network config, DNS, or connection.

### 4️⃣ Use Basic Tools

* **`ping`** → check connectivity.
* **`traceroute` / `tracert`** → check packet path.
* **`nslookup` / `dig`** → check DNS.

## 📝 Quick Checklist

* 🔌 Are cables plugged in?
* 📶 Is Wi-Fi connected?
* 🖥️ Does the device have a valid IP?
* 🌍 Can you ping a public address (e.g., 8.8.8.8)?
* 🧾 Any recent config changes?

## ✅ Recap

* Troubleshooting = detective work 🕵️.
* Start **simple** (cables, IPs, configs).
* Use **commands/tools** to test step by step.
* Goal: identify root cause, fix fast, reduce downtime.
