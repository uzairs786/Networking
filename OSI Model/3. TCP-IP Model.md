# 🌍 TCP/IP Model – A Commonly Used Model

The **TCP/IP Model** is the backbone of the internet 🌐.  
It’s a **condensed version** of the OSI model, with only **4 layers** instead of 7.

## 🏗️ Layers of the TCP/IP Model

```

+------------------+  (4) Application 🖥️ → Apps & protocols (HTTP, TLS, DNS)
+------------------+  (3) Transport   🚚 → End-to-end communication (TCP, UDP)
+------------------+  (2) Internet    🗺️ → IP addressing & routing
+------------------+  (1) Network Access ⚡ → Physical & Data Link (Ethernet, Wi-Fi)

```

## 🔎 Layer Breakdown

1️⃣ **Application Layer (🖥️)**  
- Where network applications & protocols operate.  
- Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, TLS, DNS.  
- Equivalent to **Layers 5–7** of the OSI model.  

---

2️⃣ **Transport Layer (🚚)**  
- Manages **end-to-end communication**.  
- Protocols: **TCP** (reliable 📬), **UDP** (fast ⚡).  
- Equivalent to **Layer 4** of the OSI model.  

---

3️⃣ **Internet Layer (🗺️)**  
- Handles **logical addressing & routing** across networks.  
- Primary protocol: **IP (Internet Protocol)**.  
- Supports packet forwarding across multiple networks.  
- Equivalent to **Layer 3** of the OSI model.  

---

4️⃣ **Network Access Layer (⚡)**  
- Encompasses **physical & data link** operations.  
- Handles actual transmission via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, LAN, etc.  
- Equivalent to **Layers 1 & 2** of the OSI model.

## 🆚 OSI vs TCP/IP Models

| Feature             | 🏗️ **OSI Model (7 layers)**       | 🌍 **TCP/IP Model (4 layers)** |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Layers              | 7 (detailed breakdown)            | 4 (condensed)                  |
| Application Mapping | Application, Presentation, Session | Application (all combined)     |
| Transport           | Transport                         | Transport                      |
| Network             | Network                           | Internet                       |
| Link/Physical       | Data Link + Physical              | Network Access                 |
| Usage               | Conceptual, teaching              | Real-world, internet standard  |

## 📝 Summary
- The **TCP/IP Model** is the **practical implementation** powering the internet.  
- Consists of 4 layers:  
  - 🖥️ **Application** → User apps & protocols  
  - 🚚 **Transport** → TCP/UDP for delivery  
  - 🗺️ **Internet** → IP addressing & routing  
  - ⚡ **Network Access** → Physical & data transmission  
- It maps closely to the OSI model but is simpler and widely used.
